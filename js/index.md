# scripting language 
Scripting languages are a specific kind of computer languages that you can use to give instructions to other software, such as a web browser, server, or standalone application. Many of today's most popular coding languages are scripting languages, such as JavaScript, PHP, Ruby, and Python.
- A scripting language or script language is a programming language that is used to manipulate, customize, and automate the facilities of an existing system.[1] Scripting languages are usually interpreted at runtime rather than compiled.

-  Programming languages allow coders to communicate with computers using compiled languages—source code compiled to convert into machine code. Scripting languages are a type of programming language. They are interpreted rather than requiring compilation. These are languages designed for specific runtime environments to provide additional functions, integrate complex systems, and communicate with other programming languages. One example is JavaScript, which you can use to display messages, perform calculations, and incorporate elements of user interfaces for web pages. 

- All scripting languages are programming languages. The scripting language is basically a language where instructions are written for a run time environment. They do not require the compilation step and are rather interpreted. It brings new functions to applications and glue complex system together. A scripting language is a programming language designed for integrating and communicating with other programming languages.
- Node js: It is a framework to write network applications using JavaScript. Corporate users of Node.js include IBM, LinkedIn, Microsoft, Netflix, PayPal, Yahoo for real-time web applications.

*  JavaScript in Netscape Navigator and JScript in Internet Explorer. Unlike C and many other programming languages, JavaScript had no standards governing its syntax or features, and the tho different versions only highlighted this problem. With industry fears mounting, it was decided that the language must be standardized.

* In 1997, JavaScript 1.1 was submitted to the European Computer Manufacturers Association (Ecma) as a proposal. Technical Committee #39 (TC39) was assigned to "standardize the
syntax and semantics of a general purpose, cross-platform, vendor-neutral scripting language” (www.ecma-international.org/memento/TC39.htm). Made up of programmers from Netscape, Sun, Microsoft, Borland, NOMBAS, and other companies with interest in the future of scripting, TC39 met for months to hammer out ECMA-262, a standard defining a new scripting language named ECMAScript (often pronounced as “ek-ma-script”).
The following year, the International Organization for Standardization and International Electrotech- nical Commission (ISO/IEC) also adopted ECMAScript as a standard (ISO/IEC-16262). Since that time, browsers have tried, with varying degrees of success, to use ECMAScript as a basis for their JavaScript implementations.

It is the only language you can deploy everywhere: servers, desktop browsers, mobile web browsers, and even native mobile applications.
-  Prior to Javascript, a round-trip to the server was needed to determine if a required field had been left blank or an entered value was invalid. 
- When JavaScript first appeared in 1995, its main purpose was to handle some of the input validation that had previously been left to server-side languages such as Perl.Netscape Navigator sought to change that with the introduction of JavaScript. 
- As the web gained popularity, a gradual demand for client-side scripting languages developed. At the time, most Internet users were connecting over a 28.8 kbps modem even though web pages were growing in size and complexity. Adding to users’ pain was the large number of round-trips to the server required for simple form validation. Imagine filling out a form, clicking the Submit button, waiting 30 seconds for processing, and then being met with a message indicating that you forgot to complete a required field. Netscape, at that time on the cutting edge of technological innovation, began seriously considering the development of a client-side scripting language to handle simple processing
- In 1995, a Netscape developer named Brendan Eich began developing a scripting language called Mocha (later renamed as LiveScript) for the release of Netscape Navigator 2. The intention was to use it both in the browser and on the server, where it was to be called LiveWire.
- Just before Netscape Navigator 2 was officially released, Netscape changed LiveScript’s name to JavaScript to capitalize on the buzz that Java was receiving from
the press.
-  At this time, Microsoft decided to put more resources into a competing browser named Internet Explorer. Shortly after Netscape Navigator 3 was released, Microsoft introduced Internet Explorer 3 with a JavaScript implementation called JScript (so called to avoid any possible licensing issues with Netscape).
- Microsoft’s implementation of JavaScript meant that there were two different JavaScript versions floating around: JavaScript in Netscape Navigator and JScript in Internet Explorer.
- Unlike C and many other programming languages, JavaScript had no standards governing its syntax or features, and the three different versions only highlighted this problem. With industry fears mounting, it was decided that the language must be standardized.

# note:
- Netscape Navigator was the first commercially successful Web browser. 
- Ecma International (formally European Computer Manufacturers Association) is a non-profit organization that develops standards in computer hardware, communications, and programming languages.<br>
On the web it is famous for being the organization which maintain the ECMA-262 specification (aka. ECMAScript) which is the core specification for the JavaScript language.
- JavaScript and ECMAScript are two different programming languages with many similarities. While both languages are used for web development, they are not the same language. JavaScript is an implementation of the ECMAScript standard, which defines what a scripting language should look like and how it should behave.

# JAVASCRIPT IMPLEMENTATIONS
- a complete JavaScript implementation is made up of the fol- lowing three distinct parts 
1.The Core (ECMAScript)
2. The Document Object Modal (DOM)
3. The Browser Object Modal (BOM)

# What is the difference between JavaScript and ECMAScript?
JavaScript and ECMAScript are two popular programming languages used in web development. They share many of the same features, but they are not the same language. To understand how they differ, let's take a look at the history of both languages and how they evolved over time.
# History of JavaScript
- JavaScript was created in 1995 by Brendan Eich, a computer programmer who worked for Netscape Communications Corporation. The language was initially called LiveScript, but it was quickly renamed to JavaScript due to its close relationship with Java, another popular programming language at the time.

- Since its inception, JavaScript has been used to create interactive web pages and applications. It is one of the three core technologies of the World Wide Web, along with HTML and CSS. JavaScript is now used by millions of websites around the world and is one of the most popular programming languages in use today.

# History of ECMAScript
- ECMAScript is a scripting-language specification created by the European Computer Manufacturers Association (ECMA). It was first released in 1997 as ECMA-262. The specification was later adopted by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and standardized as a scripting language for web applications.

- ECMAScript is based on JavaScript, but it also includes other features that were not present in JavaScript at the time. For example, ECMAScript includes features such as classes, modules, iterators, and generators that are not available in JavaScript.

# Differences Between JavaScript and ECMAScript
- The primary difference between JavaScript and ECMAScript is that ECMAScript is a specification, while JavaScript is an implementation of that specification. In other words, ECMAScript defines what a scripting language should look like, while JavaScript is an actual implementation of that specification.

- ECMAScript is a standard that all implementations of JavaScript must follow. Any browser or engine that implements JavaScript must adhere to this standard. This ensures that all implementations are consistent and compatible with each other.

- Another way to think about the difference between JavaScript and ECMAScript is that JavaScript is like a car, while ECMAScript is like the rules of the road. All cars must follow the rules of the road in order to be safe and effective. Similarly, all implementations of JavaScript must follow the standards set out by ECMAScript in order to be consistent and reliable.

# The Document Object Model
- The Document Object Model (DOM) is an application programming interface (API) for XML that was extended for use in HTML.
- The DOM maps out an entire page as a hierarchy of nodes. Each part of an HTML or XML page is a type of node containing different kinds of data.
- By creating a tree to represent a document, the DOM allows developers an unprecedented level of control over its content and structure. Nodes can be removed, added, replaced, and modified easily by using the DOM API.

# What is the DOM?
- The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content. The DOM represents the document as nodes and objects; that way, programming languages can interact with the page.

- A web page is a document that can be either displayed in the browser window or as the HTML source. In both cases, it is the same document but the Document Object Model (DOM) representation allows it to be manipulated. As an object-oriented representation of the web page, it can be modified with a scripting language such as JavaScript.

# Why the DOM Is Necessary
- With Internet Explorer 4 and Netscape Navigator 4 each supporting different forms of Dynamic HTML (DHTML), developers for the first time could alter the appearance and content of a web page without reloading it. This represented a tremendous step forward in web technology but also a huge problem. Netscape and Microsoft went separate ways in developing DHTML, thus ending the period when developers could write a single HTML page that
could be accessed by any web browser.
- It was decided that something had to be done to preserve the cross-platform nature of the web. The fear was that if someone didn’t rein in Netscape and Microsoft, the web would develop into two distinct factions that were exclusive to targeted browsers. It was then that the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), the body charged with creating stand- ards for web communication, began working on the DOM.
# The Browser Object Model
The Internet Explorer 3 and Netscape Navigator 3 browsers featured a Browser Object Model (BOM) that allowed access and manipulation of the browser window. Using the BOM, developers can interact with the browser outside of the context of its displayed page. What made the BOM truly unique, and often problematic, was that it was the only part of a JavaScript implementation that had no related standard. This changed with the introduction of HTML5, which sought to codify much of the BOM as part of a formal specification. Thanks to HTML5, a lot of the confusion surrounding the BOM has dissipated.
- Primarily, the BOM deals with the browser window and frames, but generally any browser-
specific extension to JavaScript is considered to be a part of the BOM. The following are some such extensions:
1. The capability to pop up new browser windows
2. The capability to move, resize, and close browser windows
3. The navigator object, which provides detailed information about the browser
4. The location object, which gives detailed information about the page loaded in the browser
5. The screen object, which gives detailed information about the user’s screen resolution
6. The performance object, which gives detailed information about the browser’s memory consumption, navigational behavior, and timing statistics
7. Support for cookies
8. Custom objects such as XMLHttpRequest and Internet Explorer’s ActiveXObject
# note
Because no standards existed for the BOM for a long time, each browser has its own implementation. There are some de facto standards, such as having a window object and a navigator object, but each browser defines its own properties and methods for these and other objects. With HTML5 now avail- able, the implementation details of the BOM are expected to grow in a much more compatible way. A detailed discussion of the BOM is included in the chapter “Browser Object Model.”

# BOM
- The Browser Object Model (BOM) is used to interact with the browser.
- The default object of browser is window means you can call all the functions of window by specifying window or directly. For example:
```
window.alert("hello javatpoint");  
```
is same as:
```
alert("hello javatpoint");  
```
- You can use a lot of properties (other objects) defined underneath the window object like document, history, screen, navigator, location, innerHeight, innerWidth,

# note:
Note: The document object represents an html document. It forms DOM (Document Object Model).
# Javascript in HTML
- The introduction of JavaScript into web pages immediately ran into the web’s predominant language, HTML. As part of its original work on JavaScript, Netscape tried to figure out how to make JavaScript coexist in HTML pages without breaking those pages’ rendering in other browsers. Through trial, error, and controversy, several decisions were finally made and agreed upon to bring universal scripting support to the web. Much of the work done in these early days of the web has survived and become formalized in the HTML specification.
- The primary method of inserting JavaScript into an HTML page is via the \<script> element.
