# objects

- JavaScript's fundamental data type is object.
- An object is an unordered collections of properties, each of which has a name and value.
- In addition to maintaing it's own set of properties, a javaScript object also inherits the properties of another object, known as it's <b>Prototype</b>.
- Objects are mutable and are manipulated by reference rather than value.
``` 
If X is an object.
let Y=X;
The variable Y holds a reference to the same object, not a copy of that object.
Any modifications made to the object through the variable Y are also visible through X.
