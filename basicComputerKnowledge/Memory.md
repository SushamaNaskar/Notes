# What is Memory in a Computer?
- In computing, memory is the space where data is stored and accessed while a computer is running.
- There are two major types of memory:

## Primary Memory (RAM & Cache) – Fast & Temporary
- Stores active data that the CPU needs immediately.
- Data is volatile, meaning it gets erased when the computer is turned off.

## Secondary Memory (Storage – HDD & SSD) – Slow & Permanent
- Stores files, programs, and operating systems permanently.
- Data remains even when the computer is turned off.

# How Does Memory Work in a Laptop/Computer?
## Step 1: Loading Programs & Data
- When you turn on your computer, the Operating System (OS) is loaded from storage (HDD/SSD) into RAM.
- When you open an app (e.g., Chrome, Photoshop, or a game), its data is copied from storage into RAM.

## Step 2: CPU Accessing Memory
- The CPU fetches instructions from RAM and executes them.
- Frequently used data is stored in Cache Memory to speed up performance.

## Step 3: Handling Multiple Applications (Multitasking)
- Each running application gets a separate memory space in RAM.
- If RAM gets full, the system uses Virtual Memory (swap file on SSD/HDD) but this is slower.

## Step 4: Saving & Shutting Down
- When you save a file, it is written from RAM → HDD/SSD (permanent storage).
- When you turn off your computer, everything in RAM is erased, but storage data remains.
