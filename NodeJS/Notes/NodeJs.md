# Node.js

Node.js is a cross-platform, open-source JavaScript runtime environment that can run on Windows, Linux, Unix, macOS, and more. Node.js runs on the V8 JavaScript engine, and executes JavaScript code outside a web browser.

- Node.js is a JavaScript runtime, built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.
- It is maintained by the OpenJS Foundation.
- Node.js allows JavaScript to be executed outside of a web browser

```
This means that while JavaScript is traditionally associated with the web and browsers, Node.js extends its reach, allowing you to run JavaScript code on servers, desktops, and even embedded systems.
```

- Node.js features an event-driven architecture and supports asynchronous I/O (non-blocking I/O).

# Cross-platform

- If an app or tool works on Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, and iOS, it is cross-platform.

# open-source

- Open-source means that the source code of a software is publicly available for anyone to:

1. View
2. Use
3. Modify
4. Share

- Usually, open-source software is released under special licenses (like MIT, GPL, Apache) that define what you’re allowed to do with the code.

## Simple example:

- Linux, React, Node.js, VS Code, Python → all are open-source.
- You can see their code, suggest changes, or even build your own version.

# JavaScript runtime environment

- A JavaScript Runtime Environment (JRE) is the environment where JavaScript code runs and gets executed.
- It provides all the APIs, engines, and tools needed for JavaScript to work.

## What does a JavaScript runtime include?

1. JavaScript Engine

- Executes JS code
- Example: V8 (used in Node.js & Chrome), SpiderMonkey (Firefox)

2. APIs

- These are features JavaScript needs but doesn’t have by itself:

* setTimeout
* DOM APIs (in browsers)
* File system access (in Node.js)
* HTTP modules, events, etc.

3. Event Loop

- Handles asynchronous tasks
- Makes JS non-blocking and fast

4. Call Stack & Memory Heap

- Where variables and functions are stored and executed

## Common JavaScript Runtime Environments

1. Browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)

- Provides:DOM (document), localStorage, Events, Window object
- Here JS is mainly used to control web pages.

2. Node.js

- Provides: File system, Network access, CLI tools, Backend server creation
- Here JS is used outside the browser, like on servers.

## Summary:

A JavaScript runtime environment = Engine + APIs + Event Loop + Tools
→ Everything required to run JavaScript code.
