# IP Address
An IP address is a unique string of numbers (or numbers and letters, in some cases) assigned to every device connected to a computer network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication.

It acts like a home address for your device on the internet or a local network—helping data find its way to and from the right place.


# you want to order pizza from Domino's online using your phone

1. you open google, type google.com
2. google.com request goes to call tower -> phone company 
3. phone company sends a requesto to DNS (to look for IP addess of google.com)

# DNS (Domain Name System)
DNS is like the phonebook of the internet. It translates human-friendly website names (like www.google.com) into IP addresses (like 142.250.190.78) that computers use to find each other.

4. DNS returns IP address of google to phone company -> call tower -> your phone 

5. now that your phone has the correct IP address for google.com
6. It makes a request to server where google.com  is present using the IP address (your phone-> call tower-> phone comapny->google.com)

# wire and wireless connection
A wired connection uses physical cables (like Ethernet) to connect devices to a network (like the internet). Requires cables and ports.
A wireless connection uses radio waves (like Wi-Fi or Bluetooth) to connect devices without cables.

# Flow Summary:
Cell Tower → Fiber Cable → ISP Hub (Jio, Airtel)→ Local Exchange → House (via wired line) → Router → Wi-Fi
